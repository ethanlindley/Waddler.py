# Waddler.py
 An open source in-development Club Penguin emulator, written in Python 3, based on @Zaseth 's Waddler.

## Getting started
You can pretty much follow the same instructions found [here](https://github.com/Zaseth/Waddler) to setup your webserver. To start the server, simply open a terminal instance in the root of the repository and run `python3 -m index 1` for the login server, and *(eventually)* `python3 -m index 100` for the game server.
